      "message": "For some reason setting \"0x0,-1,-1\" does not shut the led down, contrary to how the front led behaves.\nI found that a quick way to shut it down is to write 0 to rear_setting.\nCould also set the brightness to 0 but, since the led is actually formed by 2 leds with indipendent brightness control, that would require to write to 2 paths. This is cleaner.",
